# TODO: master

# Sadly I needed to copy paste the deploy job for several reasons:
# - strategy.matrix doesn't allow for the usage of secrets
# - uploading of artifacts would include the sensitive db information
# - workflow templates are not implemented yet. But are on the Roadmap https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/98
#   -> when these are implemented I can change it!
